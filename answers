6.An array is a collection of data items, all of the same type, accessed using a common name

7.The array index in C starts with 0 because in C the name of an array is a pointer, which is a reference to a memory location

8. If we don’t know the exact value of n, then we can’t define n variables in the function. So, we should use an array.

9.No. We can’t pass an array by value in c. But, we can pass array by reference to its address.

10. For loop execute a set of commands n number of times as per given.

11.For loops are normally used when we need a command to iterate again and again for n number of times.

12.It should be a countable set of numbers and should be in ordered pair that’s why integer is used as array index always.

13. X = x+10 in a for(i=0;i<10;i++) means iterating the same program for the 10 times i.e, x will be added by 10 for the 10 times.

14.Only one time, i=0 is executed at the entrance of for loop.

15. i<n is executed for n times as to check the condition if it is true or not. If the condition will be true then, it will go inside the for loop.

16. I++ is executed n-1 times as the increment operator in for loop for changing the values of i.
